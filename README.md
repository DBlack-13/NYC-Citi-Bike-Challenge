# NYC-Citi-Bike-Challenge

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help present a business proposal to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is worth the investment. As requested by one of the stakeholders we will present a bike trip analysis to show how this business plan is expected to turn out successful.

### Results
This table represents when bikes are checked out and how many users check them out during a period of time. We notice that most of the users utilize the bikes within the hour after checking them out. This helps show the high desire of wanting to utilize a bike to get about over a short period of time throughout the city.

This table represents the same information as above however, it also shows you which gender utilizes the bike service the most. As we can see, Males have a higher usage of the bikes than Females. This might be helpful when trying to decide on a target audience and also to review on how to gain more interest from the Female group.

The next graph is quite a different vizualization but an effective one. Here we can see the time of day each day of the week that the bikes are being most widely utilized. We can see that between 7-8 AM M-F and 5-6pm M-F shows the bussier group. This might be porotional to working hours as people may be using the bikes to get to work and leaving work. This may be coorilated to people parking a few blocks away and needing a quick transportation aside from walking that might be beneficial to them.
